## Incubation Notice
This project is a Hyperledger project in _Incubation_. It was proposed to
the community and documented [here](https://goo.gl/RYQZ5N).
Information on what _Incubation_ entails can be found in the
[Hyperledger Project Lifecycle document](https://goo.gl/4edNRc).

## Fabric-API
Fabric-API comes with a client [API](docs/api.md).

While this project represents the fruit of many man-years of development, it is
still a work in progress and we are in the process of replacing several
components, adding others, and integrating with other open source projects. This
particularly relates to security, scalability, and privacy.

Fabric-API was built with the requirements of enterprise architecture in mind by
a team that has worked in financial institutions for decades. It has a highly
modular design at both the code and runtime levels to allow for integrations 
with legacy systems.

## Building and running

### Prerequisites
Version numbers below indicate the versions used.

 * Git 2.4.6 (http://git-scm.com)
 * Maven 3.3.3 (http://maven.apache.org)
 * Java 1.8.0_51 (http://java.oracle.com)
 * JCE 8 (Java Crptography Extension) (http://java.oracle.com)
 * Protobuf compiler 3.0.0-beta2 (http://github.com/google/protobuf)

#### Optionally a JMS bus provider
 * e.g. Apache ActiveMQ 5.11.1 (http://activemq.apache.org/)

#### Installing Prerequisites on OSX
 * ```brew update```
 * ```brew tap homebrew/versions```
 * ```brew install git```
 * ```brew install maven```
 * Download and install the latest Java 8 dmg file from Oracle
 * Download _Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction
   Policy Files for JDK/JRE 8_ from Oracle, which is a zip file. Extract it and
   copy the `local_policy.jar` and `US_export_policy.jar` files to your 
   `<java_runtime_home>/lib/security`
 * ```brew install protobuf250```
 * ```brew install procmail``` if the command ```lockfile``` is not available on
   your OSX version
 * Prerequisites for building secp256k1
  * ```brew install automake```
  * ```brew install libtool```
  * You must have JNI installed. Install Xcode. Next, install the Xcode command
    line tools using the `xcode-select --install` command. You should now have
    `/System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Headers/jni.h`
  * Ensure the `$JAVA_HOME` environmental variable is unset.

#### Installing Prerequisites on Ubuntu Linux
 * ```add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/java```
 * ```apt-get update```
 * ```apt-get install git maven oracle-java8-installer```
 * ```apt-get install oracle-java8-unlimited-jce-policy protobuf-compiler```
 * ```apt-get install procmail```

### Building Steps

 * ```git clone https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-api.git```
 * ```cd fabric-api```
 * ```mvn clean package -Djava.library.path=```&lt;secp256k1_lib_path&gt;
